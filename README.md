# WP Rollback
Quickly and easily rollback any theme or plugin from WordPress.org to a previous version without any of the manual fuss. Works just like the plugin updater, except you're rolling back (or forward) to a specific version. No need for manually downloading and FTPing up the files, or learning Subversion. This plugin takes care of that for you.
